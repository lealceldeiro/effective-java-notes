# Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems

Here are, what may be seen as the core responsibilities of the software architect:

### Vision

Ensure there is a clearly communicated technical vision for the system that will help the system meet the requirements of the customers and the organization.

### Empathy

Understand the impact of the decisions taken on the customers and colleagues

### Collaboration

Engage with as many of the peers and colleagues as possible to help define, refine, and execute the vision

### Adaptability

Make sure that the technical vision changes as the customers or organization requires it

### Autonomy

Find the right balance between standardizing and enabling autonomy for the teams

### Governance

Ensure that the system being implemented fits the technical vision

### Loose Coupling in Terms of Microservices

When services are loosely coupled, a change to one service should not require a change to another. The whole point of a microservice is being able to make a change to one service and deploy it, without needing to change any other part of the system.

### High Cohesion

We want related behavior to sit together, and unrelated behavior to sit elsewhere.
