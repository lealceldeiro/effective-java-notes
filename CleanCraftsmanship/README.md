# Clean Craftsmanship: Disciplines, Standards, and Ethics

Main notes taken from the book [Clean Craftsmanship: Disciplines, Standards, and Ethics](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Craftsmanship-Disciplines-Standards-Ethics/dp/013691571X)

## Part I: The Disciplines

Engineering practices of XP (not all):

- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Refactoring
- Simple design
- Pairing (collaborative programming)
- Acceptance Tests, which is the most technical and engineering focused of the business practices of XP.

The essence of the TDD discipline is very simple. Small cycles and tests come first. Tests come first in everything.
Tests are written first. Tests are cleaned up first. In all activities, tests come first. And all activities are broken
down into the tiniest of cycles.

The goal of TDD is to create a trusted test suite. If the test suite passes, you should feel safe to deploy the code.

Refactoring is the discipline by which we manipulate poorly structured code into code with a better structureâ€”without
affecting behavior

A well-done simple design is the first indication that separates an apprentice who knows the rules from a journeyman
who understands the principles.

Collaborative programming is the least technical and the least prescriptive. Nevertheless, it may be the most
important of the five disciplines, because the building of an effective team is both a rare and precious thing.

Acceptance testing is the discipline that ties the software development team to the business. The business purpose is
the specification of the desired behaviors of the system. Those behaviors are encoded into tests. If those tests pass,
the system behaves as specified.
