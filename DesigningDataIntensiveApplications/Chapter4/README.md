# Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution

Many services need to support rolling upgrades, where a new version of a service is gradually deployed to a few nodes at
a time, rather than deploying to all nodes simultaneously.

Rolling upgrades allow new versions of a service to be released without downtime (thus encouraging frequent small
releases over rare big releases) and make deployments less risky (allowing faulty releases to be detected and rolled
back before they affect a large number of users). These properties are hugely beneficial for _evolvability_, the ease of
making changes to an application.

During rolling upgrades, or for various other reasons, we must assume that different nodes are running the different
versions of our applicationâ€™s code. Thus, it is important that all data flowing around the system is encoded in a way
that provides backward compatibility (new code can read old data) and forward compatibility (old code can read new
data).
