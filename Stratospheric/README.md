## Part I. Deploying with AWS

### 3. Managing Permissions with IAM

The [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) allows us to manage IAM [users, groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html), and policies.

This URL (replacing `account-ID-or-alias` in this URL with a user account ID) will automatically fill the corresponding input field in the user login form.

`https://account-ID-or-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`

**Best Practices for Managing Permissions with IAM**

Amazon have their own comprehensive guide on [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
